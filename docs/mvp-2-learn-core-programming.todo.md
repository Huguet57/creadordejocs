# MVP 2 - Learn Core Programming by Building TODO

Objective: minimize time-to-first-playable-fun with short onboarding and quality templates.

## Cycle 2.1 - Ultra-short onboarding

### Must
- [ ] Create 5-7 minute onboarding to reach a first runnable game.
- [ ] Create main tutorial "complete game in 15-20 minutes".
- [ ] Define visible workflow: `Resource -> Object -> Event -> Action -> Room -> Run`.
- [ ] Add pedagogical error messages (cause + recommended action).
- [ ] Instrument metrics: `timeToFirstPlayableFun`, `tutorialCompletion`, `stuckRate`.

### Should
- [ ] Add contextual hints at frequent blocking points.
- [ ] Add "next step" CTA at each milestone.

### Could
- [ ] Add "skip basics" mode for faster users.

## Cycle 2.2 - Premium templates and first game flow

### Must
- [ ] Premium templates: Pong, Runner, Dodge, Mini Platform, Mini Shooter.
- [ ] Each template with a clear goal, win condition, and next challenges.
- [ ] Add "what you can quickly change" within each template (3 safe changes).
- [ ] E2E for full flow: open template -> edit -> play -> save.
- [ ] Define minimum quality rubric for templates (clear, short, replayable).

### Should
- [ ] Add "View as code" for key template actions.
- [ ] Add short integrated glossary (maximum 1 sentence per term).

### Could
- [ ] Add optional progression badge system.

## MVP 2 Exit KPIs
- [ ] `timeToFirstPlayableFun` < 20 minutes.
- [ ] >60% complete the main tutorial without help.
- [ ] >50% publish a first game starting from a template.
